Abstract: 
The burning regime in grazing lands plays a key role in the maintenance of biological diversity. However, this regime can negatively affect insect diversity and functions. In this study, we analyzed how the burning regimes affect species diversity, functional traits and dung removal by dung beetles in grazing environments in a dry forest landscape. Although the burning regime did not influence the abundance, species richness, diversity and dung removal performance by dung beetle assemblage, the species composition of dung beetles was influenced by the burning regime, with assemblage of dung beetles being different in ranches with low or high burning regimes. In terms of functional traits, a negative effect of burning regimes on some functional traits such as tunnelers and necrophagous feeding preference was observed. However, the other functional traits did not show any influence of the burning regime, remaining stable. This pattern may be due to compensation and replacement of species that contribute to the structure and diversity stability of the dung beetles and could play a fundamental role in its structure and composition of dung beetles on the burning regimes studied.
